{"name":"Solrstrap","tagline":"A blazing fast tool for querying Solr in a Googleish fashion","body":"#Solrstrap\r\n\r\nSolrstrap is a Query-Result interface for Solr. Solrstrap is intended to be a starting point for those building web interfaces that talk to Solr, or a very lightweight admin tool for querying Solr in a Googleish fashion.\r\n\r\n#What does Solrstrap do?\r\nSolrstrap takes search queries and displays search results. It also features:\r\n* Instant search\r\n* Restful interface (you can link directly to /solrstrap.html?q=doughnuts)\r\n* Functioning history\r\n\r\n#Solrstrap is probably the fastest available rendering engine for Solr.\r\n\r\nThis because it does everything in Javascript, CSS and HTML on the client side. JSON is shot back from the server and interpeted by the web browser.\r\n\r\nSolrstrap therefore requires much less server power and bandwidth than standard search-middleware applications.\r\n\r\n##Installation, How do I make it work?\r\nOptionally edit SERVERROOT in /js/solrstrap.js to point to the \"select\" endpoint of your solr instance\r\n\r\nClick on /solrstrap.html.\r\n\r\nThats it.\r\n\r\n#What is Solrstrap made of?\r\nSolr strap is lovingly crafted from [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com).\r\n\r\n#Strengths\r\n* Requires _only_ local installation- very easy to set up\r\n* Blazing fast\r\n* Uses very little bandwidth\r\n\r\n#Weakenesses\r\n* Designed for \"open\" solr instances- needs clear access to /select/q=.\r\n* SEO basically non-existant\r\n* Will (probably) not work on truly ancient browsers (IE 7 and below)\r\n\r\n#Future releases\r\n* Support for facets...\r\n* Support for infinite scrolling...\r\n* Some form of arrow key functionality...\r\n\r\n#License\r\nIssued under the Gnu Public License v3 as per /gpl-3.0.txt\r\n","google":"UA-38564073-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
