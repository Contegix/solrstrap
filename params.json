{"name":"Solrstrap","tagline":"A blazing fast tool for querying Solr in a Googleish fashion","body":"#Solrstrap\r\n\r\n[Solrstrap](http://fergiemcdowall.github.com/solrstrap/) is a Query-Result interface for Solr. [Solrstrap](http://fergiemcdowall.github.com/solrstrap/) is intended to be a starting point for those building web interfaces that talk to Solr, or a very lightweight admin tool for querying Solr in a Googleish fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Solrstrap homepage is here: http://fergiemcdowall.github.com/solrstrap/\r\n\r\nA demo can be found here: http://fergiemcdowall.github.com/solrstrap/demo/solrstrap-0.2/solrstrap.html\r\n\r\n#Get Solrstrap\r\n\r\nThe current stable version is 0.2.\r\n\r\n[Download the latest release of Solrstrap 0.2 here](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/solrstrap/archive/v0.2.zip)\r\n\r\nFollow the download links or cloning instructions on https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/solrstrap/\r\n\r\n#What does Solrstrap do?\r\nSolrstrap takes search queries and displays search results. It also features:\r\n* Instant search\r\n* Infinite scrolling\r\n* Restful interface (you can link directly to /solrstrap.html?q=doughnuts)\r\n* Functioning history\r\n\r\n#Solrstrap is probably the fastest available rendering engine for Solr.\r\n\r\nThis is because it does everything in Javascript, CSS and HTML on the client side. JSON is shot back from the server and interpeted by the web browser.\r\n\r\nSolrstrap therefore requires much less server power and bandwidth than standard search-middleware applications.\r\n\r\n#Installation, How do I make it work?\r\nOptionally edit SERVERROOT in /js/solrstrap.js to point to the \"select\" endpoint of your solr instance, and HITTITLE/HITBODY to reference the appropriate fields in your index\r\n\r\nClick on /solrstrap.html.\r\n\r\nThats it.\r\n\r\n#What is Solrstrap made of?\r\nSolrstrap is lovingly crafted from [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com).\r\n\r\n#Strengths\r\n* Requires _only_ local installation- very easy to set up\r\n* Access to all Bootstrap functionality. Can be easily extended in a Bootstrappy way.\r\n* Blazing fast\r\n* Uses very little bandwidth\r\n\r\n#Weaknesses\r\n* Designed for \"open\" solr instances- needs clear access to /select/q=.\r\n* SEO basically non-existant\r\n* Will (probably) not work on truly ancient browsers (IE 7 and below)\r\n\r\n#Future releases\r\n* Support for facets...\r\n* Some form of arrow key functionality...\r\n\r\n#License\r\nCopyright 2013 Fergus McDowall\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n#Contact\r\nFollow/contact me on Twitter [@fergiemcdowall](https://twitter.com/fergiemcdowall)\r\n\r\nI write articles about search engine technology here: http://blog.comperiosearch.com/blog/author/fmcdowall/\r\n","google":"UA-38564073-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
